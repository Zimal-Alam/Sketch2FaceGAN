"Sketch2FaceGAN: Conditional GAN for Face Generation from Sketches"
ðŸŽ¨ Detailed Description:
Sketch2FaceGAN is a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) project that focuses on translating hand-drawn face sketches into photorealistic face images. By conditioning the generation process on input sketches, the model learns to map structural outlines to high-fidelity facial features, capturing fine details like contours, shading, and proportions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives:
Implement a Conditional GAN architecture based on the foundational cGAN paper.

Train the model on the Person Face Sketches dataset to map sketches (input condition) to corresponding real face images (target output).

Generate visually realistic face images from new, unseen sketches provided by users at inference time.

Evaluate generated outputs for:

Visual realism

Structural accuracy

Pixel-level similarity (e.g., PSNR, SSIM)

Experiment with different loss functions (e.g., L1 + GAN loss) to improve visual quality and sketch adherence.

Visualize:

Input sketch, ground truth, and generated output side-by-side

Training loss (generator & discriminator)

Epoch-wise output progression

ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
Person Face Sketches dataset â€” includes paired data: each sketch has a corresponding real face image.

Suitable for image-to-image translation tasks with conditioning.

ðŸ›  Key Components:
Generator: Takes a sketch image and generates a realistic face.

Discriminator: Evaluates whether the face is real or fake given the sketch as a condition.

Conditioning Mechanism: Combine sketch input and real/generated image (e.g., via channel-wise concatenation).

Training Strategy:

Adversarial Loss + L1/L2 Reconstruction Loss for structural alignment and texture realism

Optional enhancements:

Use of U-Net architecture for the generator to preserve low-level features.

PatchGAN discriminator for better local detail enforcement.

ðŸ“ˆ Deliverables:
Trained cGAN model with user-facing sketch-to-face inference capability.

Visual comparison: Sketch vs. Real vs. Generated images.
